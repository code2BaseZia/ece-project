I have a project for my ECE class where we have been tasked with designing a hardware peripheral for the SCOMP
architecture on a DE-10 board. Our application implements four arithmetic operations (multiply, divide, sqrt, sine) and
the application used to test our calculator will be a simple calculator app with these four buttons as functions. I
believe that this application will have to be built on top of the DE-10 hardware, but I don't necessarily think it has
to be, what are my options for implementing the actual application, any of the actual peripheral functionality will be
implemented by my teammates.
